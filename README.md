This work aims to understand and process data about NHL players. 
With data, we create a prediction model to players salary. 
The full analytical process will be implemented with the CRISP-DM in Python. 
With Feature selection we find the most influencing attributes, with Stepwise regression we find the best combina-tion of attributes.
And with Polynomial regression, we calculate the final model. 
From multiple iterations, we choose the best model. 
This model used a support application. 
This application will be created using a combination of R and Python programming languages. 
The final version of the app will be tested and evaluated user testing.
